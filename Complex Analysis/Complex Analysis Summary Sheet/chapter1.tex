\begin{eg}
    Suppose we have a functor.
    If $G_X \not\cong G_Y$, then  $X$ and  $Y$ are not homeomorphic.
    If `shadows' are different, then objects themselves are different too.
\end{eg}
\begin{explanation}
    Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are homeomorphic.
    Then $\exists f: X \to  Y$ and $g: Y \to  X$, maps (maps are always continuous in this course), such that $g  \circ f = 1_X$ and $f \circ g = 1_Y$.
    Then $f_*: G_X \to G_Y$ and $g_*: G_Y \to  G_X$ such that $(g \circ f)_* = (1_X)_*$ and  $(f \circ g)_* = (1_Y)_*$. Using the rules discussed previously, we get
    \[
    g_*  \circ f_* = 1_{G_X} \quad f_*  \circ  g_* = 1_{G_Y}
    ,\] 
    which means that $f_* : G_X \to  G_Y$ is an isomorphism.
\end{explanation}
